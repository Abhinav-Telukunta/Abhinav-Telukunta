# Hi, I'm Abhinav Telukunta  

I'm a Software Engineer with a strong foundation in **Full Stack Development** and **Applied AI**, passionate about designing scalable systems and intelligent solutions that solve real-world problems.  

My work spans developing **front-end applications using React and Angular**, building **robust backend microservices in Java**, and deploying containerized solutions using **Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS**. I focus on creating efficient, maintainable architectures that perform reliably in production environments.  

On the AI side, I specialize in **deep learning model development and integration**, leveraging frameworks such as **PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn** for training, inference, and optimization. I'm also experienced in integrating **LLM-powered features using OpenAI APIs and related tools**, bridging the gap between traditional software systems and modern AI-driven capabilities.  

Iâ€™m always excited about opportunities that combine **system design, distributed computing, and AI innovation**, where I can contribute to building reliable, high-performance software that scales intelligently.
